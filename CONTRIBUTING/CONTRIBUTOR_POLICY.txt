As a compromise between implicit contributor policy (no agreement) and heavy contributor agreement 
policy, we have adopted a minimal CLA approach.

Idea: "best effort CLA practise", as a compromise between not having CLA's and strict CLA practise. 
We have CLA template file, you must include copy in the first pull request filled with your name 
and Github ID.

Best effort = no addresses or other personal information collected (no registry policies needed), 
no automatic checking of pull requests, no legally bullet proof electronic signing of CLA, no 
transfer of copyrights.

When contributing to the project, do the following:

 1) Make copy of CONTRIBUTING/agreement_template.txt to your name, e.g. CONTRIBUTING/jane_doe.txt
 
 2) Fill in your name to the template text
 
 3) Commit changes to your repository
 
 4) Include the commit in your pull request
